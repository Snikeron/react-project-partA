## Questionnaire

1. Who is your client?
    - Simon Cook from Encode Talent. He is a recruitment principle who runs his own company and focuses on candidate side more than client side.

2. What is your client’s need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

    - A major part of his work is dealing with candidates via phone calls, where he runs an extensive questionnaire to get as much information about them possible. He spends 75% of his time on the phone and documents all his data manually in his notebook.
    - He has reached out to us to set up an online solution where he can get the candidates to fill out the questionnaire online and he can then view this once they submit it

3. Describe the client’s current setup and data.
    - He is currently documenting all his data in his notebook and then manually entering the data into an excel spreadsheet.

4. Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the client’s needs.

    - We will build an online solution. The app will feature a questionnaire that his candidates can fill out. He can view all their responses once they submit. He will have a database of all the candidates who submitted the questionnaire and will able to filter through them accodrding to his needs. This will dramatically reduce the amount of time used for phone calls and help him better keep track of all his clients.

5. Identify and describe the software (including databases) to be used in your App.

    - VS Code
    - Figma
    - Trello
    - Slack
    - MongoDB

6. Identify and describe the network setup you will use in your development.

    - literally whether it's across the internet/connections to other services, etc

7. Identify and describe the infrastructure (i.e. hardware) that your App will run on.

    - what type of cloud service (AWS, google cloud), mongo atlas, etc.

8. Describe the architecture of your App.

    - flow and structures of the app

9. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

    - basic summary of major components (candidate, admin, etc)

10. Detail any third party services that your App will use.

    - literally any platform, cloud service, host, frameworks that we are using...

11. Identify the database to be used in your app and provide a justification for your choice.

    - We will be using MongoDB as the main database for storing candidate information, because Structure of a single object is clear.
    - MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. MongoDB doesn't have complex joins.
    - MongoDB has Deep query-ability and It supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language.
    - The advantage of using MongoDB is we don't need to map application objects to database objects.
    - MongoDB store Data in the form of JSON style documents.

12. Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

    - candidate collection

13. Provide your database schema design.

    - could be a simple drawing chart

14. Provide User stories for your App.

    - **screenshot to Trello & link**

15. Provide Wireframes for your App.

    - **screenshot to lucidchart**

17. Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your App.

18. Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.

19. Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.

    - Not going to be elaborate but mention some level of TDD and how we will test our deployments and user flow

20. Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.

    - It is very important to protect the candidates personal information from potential threats.
    - In order to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclossue, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information we will be implementing a secure Authorization process.
    - The implementation will include User authentication and User authorization.
    - The communication protocol will be HTTPS(HTTP Secure) for secure communication over a computer network. 
    - In authentication, when the user successully lo

21. Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.
